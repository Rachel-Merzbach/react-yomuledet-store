## about my project
Website for selling products and accessories for birthdays

## login & registration
A user can register for the site only as a regular user, and not as an administrator.
I created a user who is the administrator.
His details are: `email: manager@gmail.com, password: Manager1121`
The user has the option to log in or register, but can not register twice with the same email address.

## an unregistered user
An unregistered user can see the products in the site but `cannot` add products to a cart.

## regular loged-in user's options
A regular user can change his self details, add products to cart and log out from the site

## manager's options
The manager can add / remove products from the catalog, add / remove discount for each product and log out from the site

## cart
The user can remove products from the cart one-by-one or remove the whole product together.
when Paypal success - the cart is removed

## home page
in the home page the user can get link to the address in `Google-Maps`, phone in `Skype` and send an e-mail using `Gmail`
